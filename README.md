__Natural Language Processing using LSTM Model for Robinhood Tweets Sentiment Analysis__

Robinhood Markets, Inc. is an American financial services company headquartered in Menlo Park, California, known for offering commission-free trades of stocks and exchange-traded funds via a mobile app. This app is particularly popular amongst young retail investors. Robinhood went public on July 29, 2021 in NASDAQ stock exchange. In this project, I trained a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to perform Robinhood’s sentiment analysis on tweets. This Natural language processing (NLP) model was able to predict people’s sentiment towards Robinhood with 95% accuracy.
